## Setup

This is a server sided mod, there is no need for clients to install this mod. Will work in a single player world if in the mods folder. All commands are avible for the entire server. May work on adding player specific commands in the future

## How it works

/alias displays the help text <br>
/alias CommandName Command will create a command that exicutes the command. can be called with /CommandName. <br>
/alias remove CommandName will remove the command from the commands list. <Br>
/alias help displays the same help text as the argumentless command. <br>
/alias list lists all of the avilible commands. <br>
